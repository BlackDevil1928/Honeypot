## 📖 Overview

This web-based honeypot mimics a potentially vulnerable login or admin page to lure attackers. While it does not implement real backend authentication, it can be used to **log intrusion attempts**, **test web security tools**, or **educate students** on cybersecurity tactics like reconnaissance, fingerprinting, and brute-force simulation.
